<p> Description:
The REDMI 5 PRO (2018) is the world's first quad-camera smartphone, and also represents a striking new aesthetic for Samsung. However, the rest of its specifications are weaker than other phones it's priced up against. If you're buying it just for the cameras, you should know that the zoom and wide-angle cameras don't deliver very good results, especially in low light. The primary camera works quite well though. Battery life is good, and the 6.3-inch display is this phone's biggest highlight. The SoC is weak, and you don't get flagship-class features. Buy this phone if you like new features that you can show off and play with, but avoid it if you want an all-rounder.</p>
